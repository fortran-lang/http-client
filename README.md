# **http**
## **Overview** ü§ó

The `http` Fortran package provides a **simple and convenient** way to make HTTP requests and retrieve responses. It aims to **simplify** the process of interacting with web services by providing a high-level API.

___
## **Features** üî•

 The package includes the following features:

 1. #### **Sending HTTP Requests:**
    - **`GET`**: Retrieve data from the server.
    - **`POST`**: Submit data to be processed by the server.
    - **`PUT`**: Replace or create resources on the server.
    - **`DELETE`**: Remove resources from the server.
    - **`PATCH`**: Partial updates to resources.
    - **`HEAD`**: Retrieve response headers without the response content.

 2. #### **Data Support:**
    - Send any type of data with requests, including support for `file` uploads and `form data`.
    
 3. #### **Response Handling:**
    - Retrieve response `content`.
    - Get the HTTP `status code` returned by the server.
    - Fetch the `length` of the response content.
    - Access response `headers`.
  
 4. #### **Custom Headers:**
    - Include `custom headers` in requests to the server.

 5. #### **Error Handling:**
    - Detect and handle unsuccessful requests gracefully, with informative `error messages`.

 6. #### **Request Timeout:**
    - Set a maximum time allowed for a request to complete, improving responsiveness.

 7. #### **Authentication:**
    - Authenticate requests to protected resources using standard authentication methods.

## **Installation** ‚öôÔ∏è

 Before building the `http-client` library, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. On Ubuntu, you need to install the curl development headers. Use the following command:

```
sudo apt install -y libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

 To use `http-client` within your fpm project, add the following to your package `fpm.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
http = { git = "https://github.com/fortran-lang/http-client.git" }
stdlib = "*"
```
## **Usage Example** üîß
The following example demonstrates how to use the http package to make a **Simple GET request** and process the response

```fortran
program simple_get
    use http, only : response_type, request
    implicit none
    type(response_type) :: response

    ! Send a GET request to retrieve JSON data
    response = request(url='https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')

    ! Check if the request was successful
    if (.not. response%ok) then
        print *, 'Error message:', response%err_msg
    else
        ! Print the response details
        print *, 'Response Code    :', response%status_code
        print *, 'Response Length  :', response%content_length
        print *, 'Response Method  :', response%method
        print *, 'Response Content :', response%content
    end if

end program simple_get

```
### Ouptut : 
```
 Response Code    :          200
 Response Length  :                    83
 Response Method  : GET
 Response Content : {
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "delectus aut autem",
  "completed": false
}
```
In this example, we make a GET request to the URL https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1 to retrieve JSON data. If the request is successful, we print the ***response code, content length, method, and content***. If the request fails, we print the ***error message***.
